In my previous blog post, I listed all features for the first release wave for Customer Insights Journeys. Let’s not lose time and also check out what the release wave for Customer Insights Data has in place for us. You will see, it actually does have interesting news.

## Get responses grounded in customer insights when chatting with Copilot

Let’s start with a bang. Before it was possible to ask Copilot directly inside the Customer Insights Data application. I haven’t use that yet in real life, but I think it is a valuable feature (when it works). Now, we can access the data from Customer Insights Data when asking Copilot e.g. in Sales or Service. It gives insights about customer interactions or data, the customer lifetime value or anything else from the contact or lead. The feature preview is coming in the mid of 2025.

So some patience is needed.

## Increase accuracy of autonomous agents by grounding them in Customer Insight

The first feature was cool already. But this one is my favorite. Since everybody talks about Copilot Studio and autonomous agents, I am happy to see it in the release wave for Customer Insights Data as well. In a few month we will be able to add customer profiles, segments, measures, and other insights from Dataverse as knowledge sources for any custom or customizable autonomous agents. Not only this, but it will also work the other way around.

We can create agents that  perform autonomous actions or respond to changes in our unified customer insights. This really gets me excited!

## Target right audience based on signals from earlier campaign

End of 2023 we got the news that Customer Insights and Marketing come closer together as Journeys and Data. But it isn’t really easy to use interaction data from CI-J in customer profiles. We were able to do it via Fabric. But this features will make it more easy. We can discover and use marketing interactions while creating segments, enhancing the personalization of engagement strategies.

And we can create powerful customer measures with interaction data along with any other data we bring into Customer Insights – Data. It was already part of Release wave 2 2024, but i am really looking forward to it.

## Other capabilities

Use Microsoft OneLake as a data source: With Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, we can generate insights from customer data, no matter where it’s stored. By directly connecting to Microsoft Fabric OneLake or using shortcuts and mirroring for external systems, we streamline data integration, saving time, effort, and costs while accelerating the path to actionable insights.

Accelerate time to insights with data in Delta Lake format: When our customer data grows rapidly with changing signals like online activities and mobile interactions, we can use the help of native Delta Lake support in Customer Insights. Then we process only incremental changes to the data, improving unification and delivering faster, up-to-date insights for timely customer engagement.

Synchronize customer data and insights directly to Fabric OneLake: With this feature it will be easy to sync the unified profiles, segments, and measures it generates directly to your Fabric OneLake, powering downstream workloads including analytics, while saving time and reducing costs.

Integrate insights faster by choosing tables and data format to sync to your data lake: With Customer Insights – Data, we can now seamlessly sync unified profiles, segments, and measures directly to Microsoft Fabric OneLake. Customer Insights – Data allows us to simply check the tables we want to synchronize to our Azure Data Lake and to select the data format to write the data in. Eliminating synchronization of the tables we don’t use means we get the data we’re focused on faster.

It also means we can save storage costs by eliminating storage of tables we’re not interested in.
## Summary

This release wave for Customer Insights – Data might not be packed with a lot of new features, but it introduces some exciting possibilities. While integration updates are useful and super important for the performance and reliability, they don’t get me quite excited. However, the real highlight lies in how we can leverage data in innovative ways, especially with Copilot Studio and autonomous agents. I can’t wait to see how they transform the way we work with CI-D!
